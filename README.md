# sorting_algorithms
Implemenetion basic sorting algorithms. plots, prediction. Additionally, graphs and prediction

numpy, pandas, plotly, scikit-learn

You can see how algorithm sort using console eg:
>>>python3 algo.py --type quick --comp ">="
# quick means use quick sort (you can write [insert, merge, quick, dual, amazing]. Dual is dual-pivot sort, amazing is hybrid (quick, insert))
# ">=" means sort increasing. "<=" for descending
# Clic ENTER
# Then write len of list to sort
# Then write all elements (be careful len) use space to write next element
# Then one more mystery question in console and voila. You can see what program do and summary

Additionally you can write eg.
>>>python3 algo.py --stat file 1
# file is a file name where you want to save test
# 1 means how many times you repaet you reapet test
# if you choose stat flag program wil do k test for random lists in range(100, 10000, step=100) and save to file

Use ipynb files(jupyter lab)(Also can use pred.py and sorting.py) to do charts, or to see how logistic regression managed to distinguish sorting algorithms
